Version: 1.5 2014-07-21
------------------------

  o Added argument "xreg" to functions "KF.deriv" and "KF.deriv.C".
    The analytical derivatives with respect to the coefficients of regressors 
    specified in the observation equation canbe evaluated.
    This is useful for example in package "stsm", where the analytical 
    derivatives of the likelihood function can be obtained now 
    for a model with external regressors.

Version: 1.4 2014-06-15
------------------------

  o Added the method "predict" for objects of class "stsmSS" 
    Those objects are returned by "stsm.class::char2numeric".
    The method is equivalent to "stats::predict.StructTS" but the forecasts
    of the components are also returned. In addition, it is straightforward
    to use for a model fitted by any of the maximum likelihood procedures 
    available in package "stsm".

Version: 1.3 2014-01-26
------------------------

  o Fixed the following warning returned by the compiler at some points 
    in the code:
    "warning: ISO C++ forbids variable length array ‘df’ [-Wvla]"

  o Removed suggested package "sspir" since it is no longer available-

  o Removed suggested package "KFAS" since the examples using this 
    package relied on a previous version of "KFAS".

Version: 1.1 2014-01-25
------------------------

  o First version submitted to CRAN.
