Version: 1.4 2014-06-15
------------------------

  o Added the method "predict" for objects of class "stsmSS" 
    Those objects are returned by "stsm.class::char2numeric".
    The method is equivalent to "predict.StructTS" but the forecasts
    of the components are also returned. In addition, it is straightforward
    to use for a model fitted by any of the maximum likelihood procedures 
    available in package "stsm".

Version: 1.3 2014-01-26
------------------------

  o Fixed the following warning returned by the compiler at some points 
    in the code:
    "warning: ISO C++ forbids variable length array ‘df’ [-Wvla]"

  o Removed suggested package "sspir" since it is no longer available-

  o Removed suggested package "KFAS" since the examples using this 
    package relied on a previous version of "KFAS".

Version: 1.1 2014-01-25
------------------------

  o First version submitted to CRAN.
