Changes in version 1.6 2014-01-24
-----------------------------------

  o The examples and code scripts have been updated now that 
    the class and methods defined in package "stsm.class" have been 
    merged in package "stsm".

  o function "KalmanFilter": the function has been adapted to the 
    new definition "KFAS::KFS" and it is again available;
    "sspir::kfilter" is not included because the archived package "sspir" 
    is not available for "R Under devel" and may give some problems when 
    submitting to CRAN and passing R CMD check. The call to "sspir" can 
    nevertheless be found in 'KF-interfaces.R' prepended by comment marks.

Changes in version 1.5 2014-07-21
-----------------------------------

  o Added argument "xreg" to functions "KF.deriv" and "KF.deriv.C".
    The analytical derivatives with respect to the coefficients of regressors 
    specified in the observation equation canbe evaluated.
    This is useful for example in package "stsm", where the analytical 
    derivatives of the likelihood function can be obtained now 
    for a model with external regressors.

Changes in version 1.4 2014-06-15
-----------------------------------

  o Added the method "predict" for objects of class "stsmSS" 
    Those objects are returned by "stsm.class::char2numeric".
    The method is equivalent to "stats::predict.StructTS" but the forecasts
    of the components are also returned. In addition, it is straightforward
    to use for a model fitted by any of the maximum likelihood procedures 
    available in package "stsm".

Changes in version 1.3 2014-01-26
-----------------------------------

  o Fixed the following warning returned by the compiler at some points 
    in the code:
    "warning: ISO C++ forbids variable length array ‘df’ [-Wvla]"

  o Removed suggested package "sspir" since it is no longer available-

  o Removed suggested package "KFAS" since the examples using this 
    package relied on a previous version of "KFAS".

Changes in version 1.1 2014-01-25
-----------------------------------

  o First version submitted to CRAN.
